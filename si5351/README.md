Si5351 Library for Arduino
==========================
This is a basic library for the Si5351 series of clock generator ICs from [Silicon Labs](http://www.silabs.com) for the Arduino development environment. It will allow you to control the Si5351 with an Arduino, and without depending on the proprietary ClockBuilder software from Silicon Labs.

This library is focused towards usage in RF/amateur radio applications, but it may be useful in other cases. However, keep in mind that coding decisions are and will be made with those applications in mind first, so if you need something a bit different, please do fork this repository. Also, since the Si5351A3 version is the one which seems most useful in amateur radio applications, this is where the current development will be focused. Once the Si5351A3 has a decent and mature feature set, hopefully we will be able to turn to the 8-output version, and perhaps even the B and C variants.

Please feel free to use the issues feature of GitHub if you run into problems or have suggestions for important features to implement.

Thanks For Your Support!
------------------------
If you would like to support my library development efforts, I would ask that you please consider purchasing a Si5351A Breakout Board from my [online store at etherkit.com](https://www.etherkit.com). Thank you!

Hardware Requirements and Setup
-------------------------------
This library has been written for the Arduino platform and has been successfully tested on the Arduino Uno and an Uno clone. There should be no reason that it would not work on any other Arduino hardware with I2C support.

The Si5351 is a +3.3 V only part, so if you are not using a +3.3 V microcontroller, be sure you have some kind of level conversion strategy.

Wire the SDA and SCL pins of the Si5351 to the corresponding pins on the Arduino. Use the pin assignments posted on the [Arduino Wire library page](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire). Since the I2C interface is set to 100 kHz, use 1 to 10 k&Omega; pullup resistors from +3.3 V to the SDA and SCL lines.

Connect a 25 MHz or 27 MHz crystal with a load capacitance of 6, 8, or 10 pF to the Si5351 XA and XB pins. Locate the crystal as close to the Si5351 as possible and keep the traces as short as possible. Please use a SMT crystal. A crystal with leads will have too much stray capacitance.

Example
-------
Include the Si5351Arduino library into your instance of the Arduino IDE. Download a ZIP file of the library from the GitHub repository by using the "Download ZIP" button at the right of the main repository page. Extract the ZIP file, then rename the unzipped folder as "Si5351". Finally, open the Arduino IDE, select menu Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library..., and select the renamed folder that you just downloaded. Restart the IDE and you should have access to the new library.

(Yes, the Arduino IDE can import a ZIP file, but it doesn't like filenames with characters such as dashes, as GitHub does when it appends the branch name with a dash. Perhaps there's an elegant way around this, we'll see.)

There is a simple example that is placed in your examples menu under Si5351Arduino. Open this to see how to initialize the Si5351 and set a couple of the outputs to different frequencies. The commentary below will analyze the sample sketch.

Before you do anything with the Si5351, you will need to include the "si5351.h" and "Wire.h" header files and instantiate the Si5351 class.

    #include "si5351.h"
    #include "Wire.h"

    Si5351 si5351;

Now in the Setup() function, let's initialize communications with the Si5351, specify the load capacitance of the reference crystal, and to use the default reference oscillator frequency of 25 MHz:

    si5351.init(SI5351_CRYSTAL_LOAD_8PF, 0);

Next, let's set the CLK0 output to 14 MHz and use a fixed PLL reference frequency (this allows for glitch-free tuning):

    si5351.set_pll(SI5351_PLL_FIXED, SI5351_PLLA);
    si5351.set_freq(1400000000ULL, SI5351_PLL_FIXED, SI5351_CLK0);

Frequencies are indicated in units of 0.01 Hz. Therefore, if you prefer to work in 1 Hz increments in your own code, simply multiply each frequency passed to the library by 100ULL (better yet, use the define called SI5351_FREQ_MULT in the header file for this multiplication).
The second value passed in the above method is the desired driving PLL frequency. Entering a 0 will have the method choose a PLL frequency for you. If you would like to use a fixed PLL frequency to drive a multisynth (in order to ensure glitch-free tuning), set the desired PLL frequency first using the method below, then specify that frequency in the set_freq() method. The PLL frequency only needs to be set once. Any additional frequency changes only need to use the set_freq() method as long as you are using the same PLL frequency as before.

Now let's set the CLK1 output to 20 MHz output, and let the Si5351 class pick a PLL frequency:

    si5351.set_freq(2000000000ULL, 0ULL, SI5351_CLK1);

In the main Loop(), we use the Serial port to monitor the status of the Si5351, using a method to update a public struct which holds the status bits:

    si5351.update_status();
    Serial.print("SYS_INIT: ");
    Serial.print(si5351.dev_status.SYS_INIT);
    Serial.print("  LOL_A: ");
    Serial.print(si5351.dev_status.LOL_A);
    Serial.print("  LOL_B: ");
    Serial.print(si5351.dev_status.LOL_B);
    Serial.print("  LOS: ");
    Serial.print(si5351.dev_status.LOS);
    Serial.print("  REVID: ");
    Serial.println(si5351.dev_status.REVID);

Setting the Output Frequency
----------------------------
As indicated above, the library accepts and indicates clock and PLL frequencies in units of 0.01 Hz, as an _unsigned long long_ variable type (or _uint64_t_). When entering literal values, append "ULL" to make an explicit unsigned long long number to ensure proper tuning. Since many applications won't require sub-Hertz tuning, you may wish to use an _unsigned long_ (or _uint32_t_) variable to hold your tune frequency, then scale it up by multiplying by 100ULL before passing it to the set_freq() method.

The most simple way to set the output frequency is to let the library pick a PLL assignment for you. You do this by passing a 0 to the set_freq() method in the 2nd parameter:

	si5351.set_freq(1014000000ULL, 0ULL, SI5351_CLK0);

If you let the library make PLL assignments, it will assign CLK0 to PLLA and both CLK1 and CLK2 to PLLB.

If that is not suitable, such as when you need glitch-free tuning or you are counting on multiple clocks being locked to the same reference, you may set the PLL frequency manually then make clock reference assignments to either of the PLLs.

Manually Selecting a PLL Frequency
----------------------------------
The Si5351 consists of two main stages: two PLLs which are locked to the 25 or 27 MHz reference oscillator and which can be set from 600 to 900 MHz, and the output (multisynth) clocks which are locked to a PLL and can be set from 1 to 160 MHz. Instead of letting the library choose a PLL frequency for your chosen output frequency, you can choose it yourself by using the set_pll() method, and then using the same frequency in the second parameter in the call to set_freq() (as is shown in the example above).

Keep in mind when you are setting the PLL manually, that you need to be mindful of the limits of the IC. The multisynth is a fractional PLL, with limits described in AN619 as:

>Valid Multisynth divider ratios are 4, 6, 8, and any fractional value between 8 + 1/1,048,575 and 900 + 0/1.
This means that if any output is greater than 112.5 MHz (900 MHz/8), then this output frequency sets one
of the VCO frequencies.

To put this in other words, if you want to manually set the PLL and wish to have an output frequency greater than 112.5 MHz, then the choice of PLL frequency is dictated by the choice of output frequency, and will need to be an even multiple of 4, 6, or 8.

Further Details
---------------
If we like we can adjust the output drive power:

    si5351.drive_strength(SI5351_CLK0, SI5351_DRIVE_4MA);

The drive strength is the amount of current into a 50&Omega; load. 2 mA roughly corresponds to 7 dBm output and 8 mA is approximately 14 dBm output.

Individual outputs can be turned on and off. In the second argument, use a 0 to disable and 1 to enable:

    si5351.output_enable(SI5351_CLK0, 0);

You may invert a clock output signal by using this command:

	set_clock_invert(SI5351_CLK0, 1);

Calibration
-----------
There will be some inherent error in the reference oscillator's actual frequency, so we can account for this by measuring the difference between the uncalibrated actual and nominal output frequencies, then using that difference as a correction factor in the library. The set_correction() method uses a signed integer calibration constant measured in parts-per-billion. The easist way to determine this correction factor is to measure a 10 MHz signal from one of the clock outputs (in Hz, or better resolution if you can measure it), scale it to parts-per-billion, then use it in the set_correction() method in future use of this particular reference oscillator. Once this correction factor is determined, it should not need to be measured again for the same reference oscillator/Si5351 pair unless you want to redo the calibration. With an accurate measurement at one frequency, this calibration should be good across the entire tuning range.

The calibration method is called like this:

    si5351.set_correction(-6190);

A handy calibration program is provided with the library in the example folder named _si5351calibration_. To use it, simply hook up your Arduino to your Si5351, then connect it to a PC with the Arduino IDE. Connect the CLK0 output of the Si5351 to a frequency counter capable of measuring at 10 MHz (the more resolution, the better). Load the sketch then open the serial terminal window. Follow the prompts in the serial terminal to change the output frequency until your frequency counter reads exactly 10.000 000 00 MHz. The output from the Arduino on your serial terminal will tell you the correction factor you will need for future use of that reference oscillator/Si5351 combination.

One thing to note: the library is set for a 25 MHz reference crystal. If you are using a 27 MHz crystal, use the second parameter in the init() function to specify that as the reference oscillator frequency.

Phase
------
The phase of the output clock signal can be changed by using the set_phase() method. Phase is in relation to (and measured against the period of) the PLL that the output multisynth is referencing. When you change the phase register from its default of 0, you will need to keep a few considerations in mind.

Setting the phase of a clock requires that you manually set the PLL and take the PLL frequency into account when calculation the value to place in the phase register. As shown on page 10 of Silicon Labs Application Note 619 (AN619), the phase register is a 7-bit register, where a bit represents a phase difference of 1/4 the PLL period. Therefore, the best way to get an accurate phase setting is to make the PLL an even multiple of the clock frequency, depending on what phase you need.

If you need a 90 degree phase shift (as in many RF applications), then it is quite easy to determine your parameters. Pick a PLL frequency that is an even multiple of your clock frequency (remember that the PLL needs to be in the range of 600 to 900 MHz). Then to set a 90 degree phase shift, you simply enter that multiple into the phase register. Remember when setting multiple outputs to be phase-related to each other, they each need to be referenced to the same PLL.

You can see this in action in a sketch in the examples folder called _si5351phase_. It shows how one would set up an I/Q pair of signals at 14.1 MHz.

	  // We will output 14.1 MHz on CLK0 and CLK1.
	  // A PLLA frequency of 705 MHz was chosen to give an even
	  // divisor by 14.1 MHz.
	  unsigned long long freq = 1410000000ULL;
	  unsigned long long pll_freq = 70500000000ULL;

	  // Set PLLA to the chosen frequency
	  si5351.set_pll(pll_freq, SI5351_PLLA);

	  // Set CLK0 and CLK1 to use PLLA as the MS source
	  si5351.set_ms_source(SI5351_CLK0, SI5351_PLLA);
	  si5351.set_ms_source(SI5351_CLK1, SI5351_PLLA);

	  // Set CLK0 and CLK1 to output 14.1 MHz with a fixed PLL frequency
	  si5351.set_freq(freq, pll_freq, SI5351_CLK0);
	  si5351.set_freq(freq, pll_freq, SI5351_CLK1);

	  // Now we can set CLK1 to have a 90 deg phase shift by entering
	  // 50 in the CLK1 phase register, since the ratio of the PLL to
	  // the clock frequency is 50.
	  si5351.set_phase(SI5351_CLK0, 0);
	  si5351.set_phase(SI5351_CLK1, 50);

	  // We need to reset the PLL before they will be in phase alignment
      si5351.pll_reset(SI5351_PLLA);


Constraints
-----------
* Two multisynths cannot share a PLL with when both outputs are < 1.024 MHz or >= 112.5 MHz. The library will refuse to set another multisynth to a frequency in that range if another multisynth sharing the same PLL is already within that frequency range.

* Setting phase will be limited in the extreme edges of the output tuning ranges. Because the phase register is 7-bits in size and is denominated in units representing 1/4 the PLL period, not all phases can be set for all output frequencies. For example, if you need a 90&deg; phase shift, the lowest frequency you can set it at is 4.6875 MHz (600 MHz PLL/128).

Raw Commands
------------
If you need to read and write raw data to the Si5351, there is public access to the library's read(), write(), and write_bulk() methods.

Changes from alpha version
--------------------------
* Added reference oscillator frequency parameter to init()
* Changed the correction factor from parts-per-ten million to parts-per-billion

Oddities
--------
Right now, this code is focused solely on the 3-output 10-MSOP variant (Si5351A3). Since some of the code was derived from the Si5351 driver in the Linux kernel, it may be useable on with the other variants, but certainly many features won't work yet. With any luck, we will get the library to work with the other variants as well, or even better, maybe someone will take the initiative, write the code, and send me a pull request.
